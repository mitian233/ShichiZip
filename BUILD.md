# Building ShichiZip

This document covers building ShichiZip from source. For installing pre-built releases, see the [README #Install](README.md#install).

## Requirements

- Xcode and Command Line Tools matching the version used in [CI](https://github.com/idawnlight/ShichiZip/actions). This project tracks the latest Xcode and adopts new Swift features eagerly, so older Xcode releases are not guaranteed to work.
- [`xcodegen`](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) for generating the Xcode project.
- [`zig >= 0.16.0`](https://ziglang.org/) for building the bundled 7-Zip libraries and Windows SFX modules.
  - If you install `zig` from Homebrew, `zig 0.16.0_1` or newer is required. The `0.16.0` bottle shipped a broken `zig ar`; see [Homebrew/homebrew-core#278849](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/278849).
- Python 3 for the localization scripts under `project/scripts/`.

```sh
brew install xcodegen zig
# or any other method you prefer for installing those tools
```

## Getting the source

The repository uses Git submodules for the upstream 7-Zip sources under `vendor/`:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/idawnlight/ShichiZip
cd ShichiZip
```

If you already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

Alternatively, each tagged release publishes a source tarball on the [Releases](https://github.com/idawnlight/ShichiZip/releases) page. The tarball ships with vendored sources already patched, `ShichiZip.xcodeproj` already generated, and a `.build-metadata` marker file. Building from it skips the patch step in `build.zig` and the `xcodegen generate` step below; jump straight to step 2.

## Build steps

ShichiZip ships in two variants that share the same app code but link against different upstream 7-Zip trees:

- **Mainline** (`ShichiZip`): linked against `vendor/7zip` ([ip7z/7zip](https://github.com/ip7z/7zip)).
- **Zstandard fork** (`ShichiZipZS`): linked against `vendor/7zip-zstd` ([mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd)), adding Zstandard and a few other codecs.

Each build is two steps: build the C/C++ static archive and the Windows SFX modules with Zig, then build the macOS app with Xcode. Xcode wraps the static archive in an embedded ArchiveCore framework so the main app and archive Quick Look extension can share one dynamic image.

### 1. Generate the Xcode project

This step can be skipped when building from a release source tarball; `ShichiZip.xcodeproj` and the generated localization files are already in the tarball. You may regenerate it if, for instance, you want to use the unsigned variant.

```sh
xcodegen generate
```

The default generated project does not hardcode a development team or signing identity. Local Debug builds may use ad-hoc signing when no team is provided. To validate signed behavior, packaging, signature verification, or Quick Action app-group behavior, configure signing in Xcode or pass a development team to `xcodebuild`.

If you only need local compile validation and want the generated project to disable signing entirely, generate an unsigned project:

```sh
SHICHIZIP_UNSIGNED=true xcodegen generate
```

The unsigned project uses the same `project.yml` and conditionally includes an unsigned signing overlay. It disables code signing for Debug and Release, but it is not suitable for packaging, release, signature verification, or validating Quick Action app-group behavior. Run `xcodegen generate` again without `SHICHIZIP_UNSIGNED` to restore the normal signing project.

### 2. Build the upstream static archive with Zig

Mainline:

```sh
zig build lib -Dvariant=mainline -Dtarget=aarch64-native -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -p build
```

Zstandard fork:

```sh
zig build lib -Dvariant=zs -Dtarget=aarch64-native -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -p build
```

Output goes to `build/lib/`. Substitute `-Dtarget=x86_64-native` for Intel builds. Xcode links this static archive into the matching `ShichiZipArchiveCore.framework` / `ShichiZipZSArchiveCore.framework`.

### 3. Build the Windows SFX modules

The app bundles small Windows SFX stubs used when creating self-extracting archives. These match the current packaging (`x86`):

```sh
zig build sfx -Dvariant=mainline -Dsfx-arch=x86 -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall -p build
zig build sfx -Dvariant=zs -Dsfx-arch=x86 -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall -p build
```

Use `-Dsfx-arch=x86_64` or `-Dsfx-arch=all` to build the other targets. Note that extra architectures are not packaged by the app. They are only intended for testing or exploration.

#### Zig: Building both variants and architectures at once

`-Dvariant=all` fans out to both upstream trees; `zig build all` runs `lib` and `sfx` together. The combined step uses a single optimization mode for everything, which produces larger SFX binaries than the staged commands above.

### 4. Build the app with Xcode

Mainline:

```sh
xcodebuild -project ShichiZip.xcodeproj -scheme ShichiZip -configuration Debug -arch arm64 build
```

Zstandard fork:

```sh
xcodebuild -project ShichiZip.xcodeproj -scheme ShichiZipZS -configuration Debug -arch arm64 build
```

Substitute `-arch x86_64` for Intel builds. Use `-configuration Release` for release builds.

## Testing

The project ships unit and UI test targets for each variant: `ShichiZipTests` / `ShichiZipUITests` for mainline, and `ShichiZipZSTests` / `ShichiZipZSUITests` for the Zstandard fork.

Run the unit tests:

```sh
xcodebuild -project ShichiZip.xcodeproj -scheme ShichiZip -configuration Debug -arch arm64 -only-testing:ShichiZipTests test
xcodebuild -project ShichiZip.xcodeproj -scheme ShichiZipZS -configuration Debug -arch arm64 -only-testing:ShichiZipZSTests test
```

Run the UI tests:

```sh
xcodebuild -project ShichiZip.xcodeproj -scheme ShichiZip -configuration Debug -arch arm64 -only-testing:ShichiZipUITests test
xcodebuild -project ShichiZip.xcodeproj -scheme ShichiZipZS -configuration Debug -arch arm64 -only-testing:ShichiZipZSUITests test
```

Drop `-only-testing` to run both suites together. UI tests automate the real app, so you have to leave the machine alone while they run.

### Flow

- **`build.zig`** patches the vendored 7-Zip tree (via `vendor/apply_7zip_patches.sh`), then compiles the macOS static archive (including the Objective-C++ shims in `vendor/SZ*.mm`) and the Windows SFX modules. Source tarballs from release artifacts contain a `.build-metadata` file and will skip the patch step, since their sources are already patched.
- **`xcodegen`** consumes `project.yml` (which includes the specs under `project/specs/`) to generate `ShichiZip.xcodeproj`. It also runs the localization generators in `project/scripts/` to produce the files under `project/generated/` and the `InfoPlist.strings` for Quick Actions. Re-run `xcodegen generate` after editing any spec or localization source. Source tarballs from release artifacts ship with `ShichiZip.xcodeproj` and the generated localization files already in place, so this step can be skipped when building from a tarball.
- **Xcode** builds the ArchiveCore framework by force-loading the static archive from `build/lib/`, then links the app and archive Quick Look extension against that framework. The app embeds/signs the framework in `Contents/Frameworks`, where the extension can load it through its runpath. Xcode also embeds the Quick Action extensions and the specific SFX module from `build/sfx/`.
